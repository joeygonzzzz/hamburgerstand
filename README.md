My first project using react and tailwind css!

This hamburger resturant is a real place located in my hometown, they really do have the best burgers you can eat. I am lucky to have known this family for almost my whole life.

I tried making this website as easy to read and as informational as I could but still with a very basic layout. If you knew this family you would know how much they appreciate being simple.

This was my first time using tailwind css. During the NuCamp front end development bootcamp we went through bootstrap but after seeing several sites done with tailwind I knew it was something I wanted to have more experience with.

The documentation is easy to read and understand, I really enjoyed learning it! Animations are also made using tailwind css.
